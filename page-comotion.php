            <p>Stephan Blount stands before a group of Madrona Elementary sixth-graders eager to be set free after sitting in classrooms all day. On this particular afternoon, he’s teaching these young students about the best and worst ways to communicate.</p>
            <p>“Let’s try a game,” Blount tells them, and the children’s faces light up instantly. “Everyone get in a circle. I’m going to whisper something in the ear of one of you. I want you to whisper that to the next person. When it’s gone around the circle, we’ll check how close it is to what we started with.”</p>
            <p>It may seem simple — but through games like telephone, Blount, a second-year master’s candidate at the University of Washington School of Social Work, is working to change outcomes for youth through the principles of a program developed at the UW. It’s called Communities That Care (CTC), and its evidence-based content is now used around the world.</p>

                  <h3>The art of empathy</h3>

                   <p> Though Dr. Becker often thinks of cancer on a scientific level, there’s a point where the science of beating cancer meets the art of empathy. Her mother, who has survived thyroid and breast cancer, was recently diagnosed with lung cancer.</p>

                  <p>“I appreciate what it takes to go through all the diagnostic procedures, the treatments, the side effects, the stresses,” Dr. Becker says. “Now, I have an incredible, renewed appreciation for how devastating this is. Not only to the patients, but to their families and friends. I’m always trying to think of how we can make it better, do better — how we can restore quality of life and prolong survival.” </p>
