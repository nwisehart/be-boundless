						<p>Stephan Blount stands before a group of Madrona Elementary sixth-graders eager to be set free after sitting in classrooms all day. On this particular afternoon, he’s teaching these young students about the best and worst ways to communicate.</p>
						<p>“Let’s try a game,” Blount tells them, and the children’s faces light up instantly. “Everyone get in a circle. I’m going to whisper something in the ear of one of you. I want you to whisper that to the next person. When it’s gone around the circle, we’ll check how close it is to what we started with.”</p>
						<p>It may seem simple — but through games like this one, Blount, a second-year master’s candidate at the University of Washington School of Social Work, is working to change outcomes for youth through the principles of a program developed at the UW. It’s called Communities That Care (CTC), and its evidence-based content is now used around the world.</p>

						<h3>Changing futures, one student at a time</h3>
						<p>For his social work practicum, Blount is helping implement CTC principles through Communities in Action, a program where Seattle residents come together to increase protective factors and reduce risk factors to promote healthy child development.</p>
						<p>Along with fellow UW master’s candidates Kelley Pascoe and Eric Agyemang, Blount is teaching students from schools in southeast and central Seattle.</p>
						<p>“We’re working to deliver life skills training to middle schoolers,” Blount explains. “Our part began after a group of agencies came together to address things in their communities affecting their youth that they wanted to work through.”</p>

						<h3>How does Communities in Action bring about change?</h3>
						<p>By partnering with leaders like Aaron Parker, the Rainier Branch manager of Therapeutic Health Services, who take the evidence-based programming of Communities in Action and apply it to their organizations. Parker takes it one step further: A long-time Little League coach, he’s using Communities in Action principles to help his team, both on the field and off.</p>

						<p>Communities in Action began in 2013, when more than 2,300 students in grades six, eight, 10 and 12 responded to a survey about the challenges in their daily lives. Like CTC’s data, the results showed that the students faced bullying, fighting, drug use and depression.</p>
						<p>Margaret Spearmon, Ph.D., chief officer of Community Engagement and Diversity at the School of Social Work, oversees Communities in Action with project manager Vaughnetta J. Barton, M.S.W. Their goal is to help communities use data about their youth to make informed decisions on how to meet kids’ needs — and develop a plan of action to meet those needs. While the communities drive the plan, local organizations and schools put it in play.</p>

						<h3>Inspired by his mother</h3>
						<p>Communities That Care is close to Blount’s heart. He was born to a 16-year-old single mother in Anchorage, Alaska, and during his childhood they often relied on outside assistance to cope with the challenges of everyday life.</p>
						<img src="<?php echo get_stylesheet_directory_uri() ?>/immersive-stories/img/socialwork/mother.png" alt="Photograph of Stephen Bount's Mother" class="img-responsive pull-image" />
						<p>“My mom was so young when she had me,” he says. “We had a lot of help from human service agencies while I was growing up. It taught me the importance of that type of work, and it gave me a lot of empathy for others facing similar challenges.”</p>
						<p>It also gave him a direction in life: social work. To support himself while earning an undergraduate degree in human services at the University of Alaska, Blount took a job working in a group home for adults with developmental disabilities.</p>
						<p>“It was just such cool work,” he says. “One resident at the group home was around my age. I could see how he became more independent when you gave him opportunities to do so.”</p>

						<h2 class="h3">Healthy behaviors and hopeful futures</h2>
						<p>A critical component of the CTC program is that it must develop organically with the help of its stakeholders, rather than be imposed on them by an outside agency that thinks it knows best what a given group needs or wants.</p>
						<p>In the case of Blount’s group, the agencies involved decided for themselves what outcomes would be most beneficial to the youth in their community, as well as how to get there. The children were then surveyed about what they perceived to be their biggest struggles. Only after that work was complete did the stakeholders choose what to tackle.</p>
						<p>In the end, they determined that it was critical to help youth resist the lures of underage drinking and smoking — behaviors that put them at risk for delinquency — and instead opt to stay in school and choose peaceful behavior over violence.</p>

						<p>Because the CTC program is evidence-based and draws on the strengths of the community it serves, Blount says he’s confident the program will change the outcomes of the sixth-graders he works with.</p>
						<p>“I’m just implementing what the stakeholders have chosen,” he says. “They’re the experts on what they need.”</p>
						<p>It’s clear that the strategy works. In the years since CTC was first implemented, numerous scientific studies have shown just how effective it is. Data from one CTC model shows that youth who participated in the program were 25 to 37 percent less likely to have health and behavior problems like smoking, drug and alcohol use, or delinquency.</p>
						<p>In addition to improving lives, the program also offers significant cost savings: For every dollar invested in CTC, $5.30 is returned in the form of lower substance abuse and delinquency costs.</p>
						<p class="text-center"><img src="<?php echo get_stylesheet_directory_uri() ?>/immersive-stories/img/socialwork/CTC-Communities-Illustration-05.png" alt="$1 invested in the CTC program equals $5.31 in savings for community health" class="img-responsive center-block" /></p>
						<p class="caption">*Washington State Institute for Public Policy, May 2017</p>
						<p>Alongside the valuable partnerships with community members, a big part of the success of CTC and Communities in Action has been student support from the Excellence in Social Impact Scholarship. Blount, Agyemang and Pascoe all received scholarships from the scholarship fund, which was established in 2016 to help reduce the debt load of social work students. The fund is transforming the school’s ability to prepare highly gifted students to lead, innovate and serve in local, national and global communities.</p>
						<p>For Blount, this financial support has meant that he can focus time and energy on his studies and the young students he works with. Even more important, it has helped him explore the career he knows he was meant to pursue. “I have always been set on doing some sort of human services or social work,” he says. “I don’t see myself doing anything else.”</p>
