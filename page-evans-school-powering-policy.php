                    <p class="bolder"><b>The City of Seattle Minimum Wage Study</b></p>
                    
                    <p>In January 2014, Seattle made history when it became the first major city in the U.S. to adopt a $15 minimum wage. </p>
                    <p>When the new law took effect the following year, policymakers were entering uncharted waters, as were workers and businesses. No one knew how the increase would affect people in a city with a skyrocketing cost of living.</p>
                    <p>With the rest of the nation watching to see how it would unfold — and waiting to see if they should follow suit — the city of Seattle contracted with an interdisciplinary team of UW faculty from the Evans School, the School of Social Work and the School of Public Health to conduct a multi-year study of the new law and its effects.</p>
                    <p>For researchers at the Evans School, the wage increase presented an unprecedented opportunity: the ability to track and study the effects of a new policy in real-time. </p>
                    <p>“Often when you’re studying public policy, you either come in after a policy has been implemented, or your team helps design a program and then studies it from the beginning,” explains Heather Hill, an associate professor at the Evans School and co-investigator for the study. “But this is different. We get to evaluate as it happens.”                     </p>
                    <p>As the new wages were implemented, the researchers tracked potential bellwethers of the law’s impact, including wages, the number of hours employees worked and the prices of local goods. </p>
                    <p>But numbers can only say so much. </p>

                  <p>“While administrative data will give comprehensive results about changes in the number of jobs and hours worked, it doesn’t tell us how workers affected by the minimum wage view their quality of life,” explains Hilary Wething, a Ph.D. student at the Evans School and member of the Minimum Wage Study.</p>
                  <p>Wething, Hill and a team of other UW students make up a subgroup of the Minimum Wage Study aimed at collecting qualitative data related to the adoption of the new law. </p>
                  <p>Over two years, their team conducted two waves of interviews with 55 local low-income workers. All 55 participants have children, and more than half are immigrants. At the start of the study, all were working for no more than $15 per hour. </p>
                  <p>Beyond hours worked or tips received, the workers divulged more detailed and complex aspects of their lives. “We asked how well their work hours fit with their family life, what works about that and what doesn't,” explains Wething. “We asked questions that allowed them to provide a lot of detail that otherwise wouldn’t be given.”</p>
                  <p>Wething previously worked primarily with quantitative data on low-wage work, and was surprised by the intimate nature of qualitative research. </p>
                  <p>“Hearing people’s stories was not only moving, it also provided a lot of context about the perspective they bring to their work lives and how they view their roles as a parent,” she says. “It feels like you’re going from black and white to full color.”</p>
                  <p>As the team embarks on the final wave of interviews this spring, Wething and Hill hope their data will help create a more complete picture in conjunction with the analysis of state administrative data and survey responses from employers. </p>
                  <p>“For instance, if we see that there were positive, negative, or no effects of the minimum wage change on workers, their earnings or their employment, then the interviews from the workers study could provide insight into why that’s the case,” says Hill.</p>
                  <p>For Wething, the opportunity to be part of the qualitative team has not only provided a one-of-a-kind research experience, it also helped her define her post-Ph.D. path. Inspired by collaborating with Evans School faculty, she hopes to follow in their footsteps and pursue a career in academia, which would enable her to continue researching the lives of low-wage workers and their families.</p>
                  <p>“To be involved with the Minimum Wage Study is a privilege,” she says. “People nationwide have eyes on what we’re doing. I feel inspired and grateful every day to get to work on this.”</p>

                    <p class="bolder"><b>The Evans School Policy Analysis and Research Group (EPAR)</b></p>

                    <p>The Evans School is a policy partner with impact far beyond the city of Seattle. By partnering with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, students at the Evans School are able to reach and influence global communities.</p>
                    <p>Reducing poverty around the world is graduate student Matthew Fowle’s dream. As a student researcher with EPAR, he’s looking for evidence-based solutions to the problem.</p>
                    <p>Fowle, an M.P.A. candidate at the Evans School, was fairly young when he first decided to work for a more equitable world. He grew up in the English countryside. His mother was born in a small town in Southern Malaysia. He recalls travelling with her to visit his Malaysia relatives.</p>
                    <p>“I remember watching mothers boiling murky water to make it safe for their families to drink,” he says. “I started to question the reasons for poverty and to grapple with the inequity between my living conditions in England and the living conditions in my mother's hometown.” This led him to develop a commitment to work on behalf of people without access to safe water, shelter, adequate nutrition or formal education.</p>
                    <p> He went on to study evidence-based social intervention and policy evaluation at the University of Oxford, which intensified his commitment to equity. “I became determined to find evidence-based solutions that would more effectively reduce poverty.” </p>
                    
                    <p>That desire led him to the Evans School, to learn how to turn research into action. </p>

            <blockquote><span>&ldquo;</span>I didn’t want to conduct research for the sake of research, I wanted to conduct research with real-world impact,” he says. “Above all, I wanted to make a difference, and that’s where EPAR comes in.<span>&rdquo;</span></blockquote>

                    <p>In partnership with the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, EPAR was established in 2008 by C. Leigh Anderson, the Marc Lindenberg Professor for Humanitarian Action, International Development, and Global Citizenship at the Evans School. </p>
                    <p>Led by Anderson and co-principal investigator Professor Travis Reynolds, ’11, an Evans School alumnus, EPAR is comprised of 15 graduate research assistants and a network of other UW faculty. The group's mission is to conduct objective research and analysis to help inform international stakeholders who tackle some of the world’s most complex and pressing financial, agricultural, public health and environmental challenges.</p>

                    <p>To date, EPAR’s evidence reviews have been used by development practitioners, including those at the MasterCard Foundation, the International Telecommunications Union,, the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, developing country government ministries and international non-governmental organizations. </p>
                    <p>One of Fowle’s EPAR research projects analyzes the use of digital financial services in developing countries. </p>

                    <p>“Many people in low-income countries lack access to basic financial services,” he says, whether because they live in a remote area far from a bank or because banks do not offer suitable services. “Globally, there are about two billion individuals without a bank account, a large proportion of whom are women.”</p>

                    <img alt="Photo of Matthew Fowle" src="<?php echo get_stylesheet_directory_uri() . '/immersive-stories/img/evans-school/van.jpg' ?>">
                    <small class="photo-caption">An advertisement for Tigo Pesa, a Tanzanian mobile phone company that allows users to send and receive money through mobile devices.</small>

                    <p>In examining populations without access to banks, researchers began looking instead at what resources are widely available: phones. </p>

                  <p>“Half of the unbanked population has a mobile phone,” says Fowle. “In Kenya, for example, almost 90 percent of the population has a mobile device, which represents a significant opportunity for financial inclusion.”</p>
                  
                  <p>Through money transfer apps available on mobile phones, people can save, send and receive money, creating greater financial inclusion and — ideally — a pathway out of poverty.  </p>
                  
                  <p>Fowle and his EPAR team members trawled through data from four South Asian and four Sub-Saharan countries to determine both why people adopt mobile money services and how they regularly use it. </p>
                  
                  <p>In just the eight years since EPAR has been in operation, Anderson has seen the immense benefit of the EPAR experience to students’ careers. “Combined with their Evans School professional training, this makes them phenomenal researchers. They learn great technical tools for finding, analyzing and communicating information; they learn from each other; and they push themselves beyond the threshold of what’s considered ‘quality’ work,” she says. “And they get hired very quickly after they graduate; it’s a problem for us every June — we lose these students to great places,” she adds with a laugh.</p>

                  <p>Fowle plans to earn his Ph.D. and continue to conduct original, innovative poverty reduction research that makes a difference in people’s lives, a decision influenced by his time at the Evans School.</p>
                  
                  <p>“It’s a rich and collaborative environment,” he says, “and a unique opportunity to conduct research with a dedicated team of talented colleagues and mentors who are renowned experts. Working with EPAR has enabled me to help tackle the complex equity problems that stirred my passions so strongly as a boy.”</p>
                  
                  <p>Both Wething’s and Fowle’s extraordinary experiences have been fueled by the generosity of donors, whose gifts make student scholarships, fellowships and faculty professorships possible.</p>
                  
                  <p>“Giving enables students to focus on being their best and brightest research selves,” says Wething. “I don’t have to worry about making ends meet. I can just be fully immersed in this process.”</p>
