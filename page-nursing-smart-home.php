                    <p>Ruiz, 76, who resides in an assisted living facility in South Seattle, assumed it was just a bad allergy season. </p>

                    <p>But a sensor placed in her apartment by researchers from the UW School of Nursing soon alerted her to the fact that something else could be at fault: The humidity levels in her apartment were troublingly low. And when humidity levels drop, your nose, throat and sinuses react. Even more worrisome than that, low humidity also enables cold and flu viruses to spread more easily and stay alive much longer. So Ruiz went out and purchased a humidifier — a simple solution, but one that could not have been reached without the sensor.</p>

                <p>The person behind the sensor — and the helpful data it produced — is <a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/gdemiris/">George Demiris</a>, Alumni Endowed Professor at the <a href="https://nursing.uw.edu/">UW School of Nursing</a>.</p>

                <div class="inset">
                  <p><b>By 2030</b>, more than <b>20% </b>of the U.S. population <b>will be age 65 or over</b></p>
                  <hr>

                </div>

                <p>“Older adults are now staying independent for as long as possible at the residence of their choice,” says Demiris. “They’re choosing to age in place, rather than move — whether to an assisted living facility or other setting — every time there’s a change in their health care needs.”</p>

                <p>Demiris is leading a study on how smart homes outfitted with sensors could allow older adults like Ruiz to maintain independence for long as possible. Crucial to enabling seniors’ independence is preventative health care, and as such, the ability to quickly detect health issues. Demiris is working to make this happen as part of the <a href="http://www.health-e.info/">HEALTH-E initiative</a>. </p>

                 <p>“Originally I looked at technologies that were more traditional in terms of monitoring vital signs or capturing symptoms of a chronic disease,” says Demiris. But these devices can be complex, and they often require that an older adult or a family member learn how to work them. </p>

                  <p>Instead he turned to common household devices such as video cameras, digital thermometers and door, window and motion sensors. In the right combination, Demiris discovered, these ordinary devices can turn an average house into a smart home — one that’s easy for a non-technophile to manage.</p>

                  <blockquote class="float"><span>&ldquo;</span>If someone opens the refrigerator several times over the course of an hour, or if they’re becoming more sedentary or using the bathroom more frequently, these could all be early indicators of a specific condition or health issue<span>&rdquo;</span></blockquote>

                  <p>The devices catch deviations from a daily routine that a person may not notice, but which, over a period of time, can often mean something more serious.</p>

                  <p>“If someone opens the refrigerator several times over the course of an hour, or if they’re becoming more sedentary or using the bathroom more frequently, these could all be early indicators of a specific condition or health issue,” he says. Dementia. Alzheimer’s disease. Frailty. All conditions that benefit from the earliest possible detection — and action.</p>

                  <h2 class="leadin">How to turn a house into a smart home </h2>

                  <p>When deciding where to do his research, Demiris didn’t turn to a lab. Instead, he brought the study to the participants, in their own houses. </p>

                  <p>The older adults in the study were residents at local assisted-living facilities, and they opened their homes to the research team for three months. </p>

                  <p>At the outset of the study, participants met with Demiris and research assistant Yong Choi, a Ph.D. student in biomedical and health informatics, to choose which sensors they wanted to have installed. In addition to a humidity gauge, Mary Ruiz opted for light and temperature sensors, as well as a video camera so she could keep an eye on her cat, Sparky.</p>

                  <p>Next, Choi set up the devices in their home, along with a small laptop that collected all the data. The participants then went about their daily lives, sometimes forgetting the devices were there.</p>

                  <p>The initial results of Demiris’ study are promising. In addition to Mary Ruiz, several other participants have taken their data and started discussions with their clinicians. One saw that she had slowly become a night owl and needed more sleep; another used video camera footage to make sure she was staying active. </p>
                  
                  <p>Eventually, Demiris hopes that the study will show assisted-living facilities and retirement communities that sensors should be standard features in each residence. </p>
                  
                  <p>With additional support, the School of Nursing hopes to build on Demiris’ work through the creation of a new home health care simulation lab. And by focusing more on the burgeoning area of informatics, the school is poised to lead the field as it takes on a bigger role in future health care.</p>
                  
                  <p>Students also stand to benefit from taking part in such cutting-edge opportunities with training that equips them to provide quality care to patients who rely increasingly on technology.</p>
                  
                  <p>“We have these incredible technologies that, when put together, can help us better understand our daily lives and needs,” says Demiris. “I believe that technology can empower more people, especially older adults and their families, to become actively involved in their own health care.”</p>
