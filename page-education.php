              <p>When it was first laid out, Jessica [Granger] just kept saying that it’ll be hands-on; you’ll be right there in the classroom coaching, and I didn’t know what that looked like. As we continued to practice, and I saw the changes in the kids’ thinking, I saw that it was really good work to do, so. I’d say I really enjoyed it. </p>

              <p>It changed my thinking; I used to love reading, now I love teaching math, actually, more. And the kids learn and grow, I think, from each other, and seeing how different people solve things. And I even learn from them. I tell them every day we’re both coming to teach and learn, so I learn from them just as much as they learn from me.</p>

              <p>I feel like I grew up in kind of two very different worlds. Bailey Gatzert [Elementary], it’s actually where I spent most of my time growing up. And so all my friends were kind of in that Central District area. And that school was very similar to Lakeridge in terms of the population. It’s like a block away from a housing complex. All my friends were of, like…I mean it was so diverse, and that’s kind of where I grew up and where my identity was set. </p>

              <p>So when I went to Eckstein [in the Ravenna neighborhood] for middle school, it was a huge, huge shift. And I remember going from literally being at the top of my class in fifth grade to, like, really struggling to stay afloat in middle school. And I remember in sixth grade thinking, “Oh man, if I’m having this much trouble in middle school, like, how are my friends doing?” I think that was the first time I realized that there was this idea of inequity in our education system.</p>
