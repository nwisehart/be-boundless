						<p>When Lisa Lovejoy set off for college, the freshman had big dreams. “I always wanted to do great things, to do things in the world,” she says.</p>
						<p>Unfortunately, she took more than dreams to Bard College. She took the abuse she suffered as a child. She also took depression, mania and an ever-present sense of loneliness. Lovejoy lost sleep, lied to her teachers, stole a friend’s phone card and skipped classes.</p>
						<p>“I completely fell apart in a short amount of time,” says the Seattle native.</p>

						<h2>No Family Goes Untouched</h2>
						<p>Mental illness comes in many forms, from anxiety to schizophrenia, but all these illnesses share a stigma; people don’t want to talk about them. The distressing irony is that most of us know someone with mental illness.</p>
						<p>“One-third of Americans will have a mental health disorder, a substance-use disorder or both at some point in their lives,” says Jürgen Unützer, M.D., MPH, M.A., the chair of UW Medicine’s Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences. “Unfortunately, no family goes untouched.”</p>
						<p>Lovejoy says being miserable felt normal. “Back then, people just thought you had emotional problems,” she says. “It took me a long time to get help.”</p>

						<h2>Falling Into the Dark</h2>
						<p>Lovejoy handled her mental health issues as best she could. She took a series of easy jobs, but felt ashamed. She married a man, even though she thought she might be gay.</p>
						<p>At the same time, Lovejoy was carrying a major burden: a creeping sense of despair. “Every time I went to that place in my head, I called it the darkness,” she says. “It felt like I was falling down a chute.”</p>
						<p>By the time she turned 39 in 2007, Lovejoy was divorced and living in an attic apartment with her two children: manic, depressed, worn out and barely maintaining her job. At a doctor’s appointment, she broke down and wept, and the doctor admitted her to the psychiatric wing of UW Medical Center.</p>
						<p>“Finally, someone noticed that I was miserable,” Lovejoy says.</p>

						<h2>A Life Dissolves</h2>
						<p>That was the first of three hospitalizations that year, and after that, Lovejoy’s life began to dissolve.</p>
						<p>Her boss gently told her not to come back to work. She lost her apartment and moved in with her boyfriend.</p>
						<p>And in a decision that Lovejoy still regrets, she surrendered custody rights to her two children, saying that she felt like “a horrible mother.”</p>
						<p>Then she found a lifeline at Harborview Medical Center: dialectical behavioral therapy or DBT.</p>

						<h2>The Turning Point</h2>
						<p>DBT, a type of cognitive behavioral therapy, brings together two therapeutic opposites, acceptance and change. It was developed by Marsha Linehan, Ph.D., ABPP, a professor of psychology at the University of Washington.</p>
						<p>In a stroke of good fortune, Harborview was doing research on DBT when Lovejoy, encouraged by a friend, called the hospital. Doctors diagnosed her with borderline personality disorder and entered her into the trial, which involved group therapy and individual counseling.</p>
						<p>“At first, I hated everyone in the group,” says Lovejoy with a laugh. But she started exercising and meditating. She argued less with her boyfriend and felt less depressed. The relationship with her kids improved.</p>
						<p>“I saw examples of people who were getting much better,” says Lovejoy. “That gave me a lot more confidence.”</p>

						<h2>Working With Hope</h2>
						<p>Today, Lovejoy works at the Housing and Recovery Through Peer Services (HARPS) program, funded by King County and administered at Harborview. HARPS staff help patients transfer into housing after they leave hospital-based behavioral health programs.</p>
						<p>If this sounds as though Harborview is managing a social service program, it is. Patients come from all walks of life, and some are hungry, poor and homeless. “All of these components have an impact on health,” says Darcy Jaffe, ARNP, Harborview’s chief nursing officer and senior associate for patient care services. “You’re not a healthcare provider if all you do is what you bill for.”</p>
						<p>In the case of mental health and wellness, Harborview is part of a team, working with government and nonprofits on programs like HARPS. Employees like Lovejoy — formerly a hands-on client liaison or “peer bridger” and now a program coordinator — develop deep bonds with the people they help.</p>
						<p>“So much of what we do is working with motivation and hope,” says Brigitte Folz, MSW, LICSW, the head of HARPS. “Lisa seemed just like a perfect fit for the HARPS program.”</p>

						<h2>Advice for the Journey</h2>
						<p>Now 50, Lovejoy has a smile that lights up a room and a lively, self-aware sense of humor. She’s in therapy and she meditates; lithium helps, too. The diagnosis of borderline personality disorder no longer applies.</p>
						<p>That said, she notes that recovery is not a straight upward line: there are hills and valleys, stops and starts. This is a truth that patients need to hear — especially when they’re having a hard time.</p>
						<p>“You can get back to that high point again,” she tells them. “It’s a zigzag. It’s a journey. And it’s hard and joyous.”</p>
