<h2>A day in the lab</h2>
<p>On a Friday morning, students filter into UW Bothell’s <a href="http://digitalfuturelab.com/">Digital Future Lab</a> (DFL) before their weekly check-in meeting.</p>
<p>Adorning the cozy room’s walls are project timelines, a software architecture flowchart, graphic novel illustrations of a red- and purple-tinted alien world. A giant red beanbag chair is tucked in the corner. Rows of computers, covered in Post-it notes and stickers, compete for space with toys and snacks: stuffed Pokémon, jelly beans, a foam Batman figurine, peanut-butter pretzels, a tiny basketball.</p>
<p class="callout">It may look like you’d expect a <br>game studio to look, <span>but it doesn’t act like one.</span></p>

<p>Aina Braxton, ’12, the lab’s assistant director, kicks off the meeting by asking everyone to gather in a circle to share their names and <span data-tooltip="Helping make communities more trans- and genderqueer-friendly, gender pronoun check-ins are used to recognize the fluidity of gender, and in a respectful effort to avoid making assumptions about others’ gender identification" data-tooltip-position="top">gender pronouns</span>.</p>
<p>“Aina. She, her.”</p>
<p>“Jason. <span data-tooltip="Pace uses the gender-neutral pronouns they and them" data-tooltip-position="top">They, them</span>.”</p>
<p>“Malik. He, him.”</p>
<p>Braxton and Executive Director Jason Pace remind newcomers that it’s part of their culture to start every meeting this way. They’ve normalized it, Braxton says, “because we don’t want to make assumptions about you or your identity.”</p>

<p class="callout"><span>Working to address the lack of diversity in video games and tech,</span> Pace and Braxton bring difference to the forefront of all they do.</p>
<p>With a small core of professional staff, the lab’s team of more than 40 students from a variety of backgrounds takes on everything from art, design, music composition and programming to production, project management and marketing. Along the way are constant opportunities to recognize their diversity, to learn about different backgrounds and cultures and, ultimately, to become better communicators.</p>
<p>The day’s check-in doesn’t last long, though: The agenda is packed.</p>
<p>Two developers have created a new build for Hug the Line, a tower-defense-style game in which the user helps benevolent creatures navigate a treacherous maze. Then it’s on to critiquing new features for Corrupted, a space-age puzzle game.</p>
<p>In Pace’s opinion, the team needs to develop a unifying thread that runs throughout the game’s individual levels. Right now, it’s not quite there.</p>
<p>“Jason has industry-level experience and standards for the work we do,” lead designer Emmett Scout says of Pace, who uses the pronouns they, their and them.  “They won’t let us get away with anything less than that.”</p>

    <h2>Behind the mission</h2>
    <p>For Pace, who came out as gay at age 16, the DFL is a chance to combine the activism of <span data-tooltip="Pace uses the gender-neutral pronouns they and them" data-tooltip-position="top">their</span> youth with <span data-tooltip="Pace uses the gender-neutral pronouns they and them" data-tooltip-position="top">their</span> deep background in tech and gaming.</p>
    <p>Much of Pace’s two decades of software development experience was spent at Microsoft, where <span data-tooltip="Pace uses the gender-neutral pronouns they and them" data-tooltip-position="top">they</span> helped direct and produce everything from casual games to the Xbox flagship title Halo. And while <span data-tooltip="Pace uses the gender-neutral pronouns they and them" data-tooltip-position="top">they</span> loved the creative challenge, <span data-tooltip="Pace uses the gender-neutral pronouns they and them" data-tooltip-position="top">they</span> learned a lot about the industry that <span data-tooltip="Pace uses the gender-neutral pronouns they and them" data-tooltip-position="top">they</span> wanted to change.</p>
    <p>“Video game studios are still very much a <span data-tooltip="When a person’s gender identity conforms with the gender they were assigned at birth; not transgender" data-tooltip-position="top">cisgender</span>, white, straight male world,” Pace says. And it’s not often a very tolerant world, either. One need go no further than video game forums, chatrooms or comment boards to see offensive slurs tossed around casually — or, worse, to see targeted hate campaigns.</p>
    <p>More broadly, the tech industry is often criticized for its dearth of diversity. <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/statistics/reports/hightech/?utm_content=&utm_medium=email&utm_name=&utm_source=govdelivery&utm_term=">Employment is skewed</a> in favor of whites and men, and against other groups.</p>
    <p>So when Pace joined UW Bothell in 2012, <span data-tooltip="Pace uses the gender-neutral pronouns they and them" data-tooltip-position="top">they</span> wanted to change that. <span data-tooltip="Pace uses the gender-neutral pronouns they and them" data-tooltip-position="top">They</span> started by bringing on Braxton, a UW Bothell graduate who was committed to equity and social justice. Together, the two have focused their efforts on countering bias and toxic work culture. They have baked into the identity of the DFL what they call “radical diversity”: the intentional focus on maximizing and foregrounding difference on a team of people with different backgrounds, abilities and academic focuses.</p>

    <p>In planned topic discussions or spontaneous conversations, some students might speak about the racism or sexism they’ve experienced. Some might speak about neurological differences, or <span data-tooltip="Short for neurological diversity, neurodiversity acknowledges the immense variation in human brains and minds as natural, and embraces all as a valuable form of diversity" data-tooltip-position="top">neurodiversity</span>. For example, Pace, who has ADHD, likes to talk about how <span data-tooltip="Pace uses the gender-neutral pronouns they and them" data-tooltip-position="top">they</span> have drastically different communication needs than people with Asperger’s. </p>
    <p>And some students, like Scout, who came out in the lab, talk about gender identity:</p>
    <p class="callout quote">“After four years of working in a space where my identity as a queer person, as a trans person, was not a negative, I feel way more comfortable with who I am,” he says.</p>
    <p>“Here, we’re not just accommodating different folks. We’re valuing their differences and looking for how they can be beneficial to everyone.”</p>
    <h2>Ghostlight Manor goes commercial</h2>
    <p>In September, a handful of students and staff from the DFL had the opportunity to showcase their first commercial release, Ghostlight Manor — a game that is inspired by classic monster movies and arcade strategy games — at an open house hosted at Microsoft. Scores of game enthusiasts wandered among rows of computers, chatting with representatives from over 50 developers from around the world that were publishing their games on Xbox and Windows 10 devices.</p>
    <p>Braxton watched as a woman gave Ghostlight Manor a try. A phalanx of unknown monsters, masked in white, advanced down the screen in serpentine fashion. The only defense was Lightbot, whose beams of light first revealed the monsters — ghosts, demons, vampires — and then scared them away.</p>
    <p>“Oh my gosh!” said the woman. She had just unmasked a pair of zombies, and they were mad.</p>
    <p>Braxton smiled. “Just to see how shiny and glitzy our product has become, and to see it standing up next to all these other titles, makes me really proud,” she said.</p>
    <p class="callout">
      Test your Ghostlight Manor mettle with a free 11-level demo, <span>available for download <a href="example.com">here</a>.</span>

      <h2>Teaching, learning — and creating</h2>
      <p>All of the Digital Future Lab’s games start as research prototypes led by the DFL and Professor of Computing and Software Systems (CSS) Kelvin Sung. Funded by a National Science Foundation grant and support from Google and Microsoft, Sung’s program gives introductory computer science students the opportunity to learn basic programming concepts by building casual games. </p>
      <p>Successful prototypes like Ghostlight Manor make their way into the co-curricular commercial pipeline of the DFL, opening up educational opportunities across all disciplines — from computer science and communication to social justice and art. Students can get involved through credit capstones and independent study projects, or even a course taught by Pace, who is core faculty in Interactive Media Design (IMD), and affiliate faculty in CSS and Interdisciplinary Arts & Sciences (IAS). </p>
      <p>Other students dip their toes into the world of game creation as game testers or junior designers or developers. Only a few students, though, hold paid senior internships, something Pace and Braxton wish to change.</p>
      <p>“Unpaid internships aren’t sustainable,” says Braxton. “To create a truly equitable workplace, we need paid internships for more students — not just those who can afford to work without pay.”</p>  
      <h3 class="headline-gold">Help make a difference</h3>
      <p>When you support a student program like the Digital Future Lab, you can help students get hands-on, career-shaping experiences that prepare them for the workforce.</p>

                        <p>Immediately after releasing the educational prototype, the DFL begins work toward releasing Ghostlight, now called Ghostlight Manor, as their first commercial release, for mobile devices. The team grows to about 25 interns; they design a 50-level progression with a dozen unique game modes and six unique game environments.</p>

                        <h3><span>Fall 2016: </span>Developing a richer game experience for desktop</h3>
                        <p>After releasing the mobile version of Ghostlight Manor, the DFL decides to prep the game for PC/Mac and raise the quality bar even higher. The team working on the game grows to about 30 interns; in addition to reworking most of the game, they add a robust user research and play testing team that focuses on accessibility, balance — and the “fun factor.”</p>
