PREDATOR:
There was a British anthropologist that once said that there is no two species on Earth that are so similar in social behavior as wolves in humans. For example we found here that the most common cause of death for adult wolves in Yellowstone since we don't have any human hunting or trapping the most common cause of death is to die fighting to protect your family and your territory from a rival pack

PREY LECTURE:
Animals that are in really good condition have the luxury of not having to feed so much they can actually be quite vigilant whereas animals that are emaciated desperate tend to have to focus all their time eating and not looking for predators. So simply put if you can see the ribs and you can see the parts of the backbone and the hip bones sticking out that animals not doing very well.

SCAV: 
a quarter to a third of all bison consumption by wolves is carcasses. And so rather than risk your life killing a bison they wait for a carcass to show up especially this time of year especially during the rut. So this could be a huge subsidy for wolves and could be important in that the impact of wolves and elk. 

HUMAN:
We use a lot of electric fence to keep them bunched together so that they relearn that herd instinct to keep their young close and in the middle. The animals that get killed go off, way off on their own. Wolves do not want to get killed. Wolves are very very smart hunters. They would much rather go kill rabbit or a fawn and so when a wolf or a pack of wolves comes up on 300 head of cattle that are all staring them down their not going to get themselves killed over one meal.
